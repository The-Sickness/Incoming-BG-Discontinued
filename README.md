* Have even been in a situation in a BG or Epic BG to where you don't have time to type out that there is an INC at your location/flag? Stopping to type out your message for your group will take away from you defending the flag. 

 

* Playing any type of PVP is usually fast paced and there isn't room for mistakes. Taking time to type things out takes too much time to do. Well this addon will make it to where you do NOT have to type anything to call out an INC. All you have to do is click on the appropriate button to call out the INC for you. 

 

* Examples of Buttons:

Zerg, or 1-4 (you choose the number) at your location.

All Clear at your location

Incoming at your location

Send More to your location

 

* In order to use the addon you must type /inc. Once the UI is up you can move it to where you desire. Once you have it where you want it type /inc l and it will save your settings for whenever you use /inc again to enable it. There are slash commands listed below.

 

* Slash Commands:

/inc Load the Incoming interface

/inc u Unload the Incoming interface

/inc l Lock and save the Incoming interface into the current screen position

/inc r Reset, unlock, and center the Incoming interface

/inc ? Help display will list all the slash commands

/inc v Version of Incoming

/inc s# Scale the Incoming interface to a percentage [ s50 would scale to 50% ]  (Use this at your own risk)

/inc b Brief messages in battlegrounds

/inc f Full messages in battlegrounds

/inc t Puts a message in Chat that you are using the Incoming addon and gives a description on its function.

 

*This addon works in BG's that have "zones". If the BG doesn't have zones it will NOT work. The only BG's that I have found that it doesn't work on is ASHRAN and SEETHING SHORE. that's because they have no zones. All you are doing is killing the enemy boss. And just fighting for Azerite.
