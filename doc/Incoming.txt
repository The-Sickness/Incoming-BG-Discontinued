Ver 10.0.2 - 11/12/22
Updated message wording to be alittle better accepted


Ver 1.16 - 5/13/17
- updated the add-on to patch 7.2.x to eliminate out of date nag

Ver 1.15 - 1/10/16
- updated the add-on to patch 6.2.x to eliminate out of date nag
- I noticed that invoking /inc outside of battlegrounds you get an error dealing with 'SetPoint', but if you 
  use /inc ? after that the interface loads. I fixed this issue. It will now load the interface, but will 
  unload when it switches to a different zone outside the battleground. Inside the battleground it should
  load/unload automatically, if not just enter /inc to load it. 

Ver 1.14 - 12/14/14
- updated the add-on to patch 6.0
- Looked into adding new battlegrounds. Blizzard has stopped adding SubZone information in the battlegrounds.
  Since this add-on uses the SubZone to tell other party members your location in the battleground, this will
  take more research. I'm open to suggestions on how to accomplish this. At any rate this add-on would not
  be of much use in the new battlegrounds. 


Ver 1.13 - 7/18/13
- Updated the add-on to patch 5.3

Ver 1.12 - 4/24/13
- Updated the add-on to patch 5.2

Ver 1.11 - 12/4/12

- Errors due to the BATTLEFIELD chat type being removed in patch 5.1. Switched to instance now.
- Updated the add-on to support patch 5.1

Ver 1.10 - 10/6/12

- Added the '/inc t' switch to advertise the Incoming mod to those around you.
- Removed '[Incoming]' from all messages sent in battlegrounds to eliminate any confusion.
- Added zones for Alterac Valley. I see it as being problematic though. Some areas have no subzones and will
  display as 'Alterac Valley'. Let me know if you try to use it somewhere and it doesn't say at least
  'Alterac Valley'. I think I have them all, but I haven't been inside all the towers yet.

Ver 1.09 - 9/30/12

- Added short message mode '/inc b' and full message mode '/inc f' slash commands
- Added saving of UI position and scale and message mode using the lock command '/inc l'. Remember to use it.
- Added faction instead of 'incoming enemies' it now states either 'Horde' or 'Alliance'.

Ver 1.08 - 9/18/12

- Removed last bug fix added. It was causing an issue with a nil reference unless you loaded the UI once. Removed some 
  code dealing with frame positioning (lock and reset commands). It was removed from the Blizzard API and causing 'attempt to index 
  global frame (a nil value)'
- No enhancements, this was just a bug fix to stop errors due to API changes.

Ver 1.07

- KippG added a bug fix for autoloading. Autoloading didn't work unless the /inc command was used first. 
- Updated to support the new version of WOW (5.0.4)

Ver 1.06

- KippG kindly contributed code to auto load the interface in a battle ground. Thanks KippG.
  I added the code and tried it out. If you reset your UI while in the battle ground, you will need to do the /inc again

Ver 1.05

- Added interface scaling up and down
- Incoming reset will also reset interface scaling back to 100% or you could issue /inc s100

Ver 1.04

- Added back the old 'Incoming' button for those that like a generic message with no count on incoming enemies
- Added an additional button 'Send More' to ask for more help at a location
- Enlarged the interface frame to support more buttons


Ver 1.03

- Added 'Mine' for Arathi Basin. If you stand on the mine roof, or in that area, there is no sub zone of 'Gold Mine' listed
  like it is everywhere else in that zone. This is another area like the flag room in Warsong Gulch (Alliance) where no sub 
  zone is listed. Since there is a zone listed of Mine though. That will be used for that area now.
- Redesigned the user interface so that instead of having one button with 'Incoming', it is now five buttons for incoming
  enemies. Numbers 1,2,3,4, and a Zerg button. Pressing the number announces that many incoming enemies. Zerg, obviously
  means 'a whold bunch' of enemies.
 


ver 1.02

- Added lock slash command 'l' to lock the incoming interface at it's current screen position.
- Added a reset slash command 'r' that will unlock the incoming interface and position it to the center of the screen and make it draggable.
- Added a version display slash command 'v'
- Added a help slash command '?' that will list all the slash commands.


Ver 1.01

- Fixed zone problems. Some zones had no sub zone. Modified the code to check for a sub zone and if blank use the zone.



Ver 1.0

- Added new battlground support for Battle for Gilneas, Isle of Conquest, Warsong Gulch, Twin Peaks, Tol Barad.
- Added the ability to load and unload the interface anywhere.
- Added messages displayed in the chat window for better feedback to the player. Loaded and unloaded messages and 
if a button is pressed and you're not in a supported zone, you will get an appropriate message.
- Cleaned up and updated the TOC file for Wow version 4.3.


Ver .10
